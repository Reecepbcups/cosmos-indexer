# Setup the values correctly and ranges for blocks

# TASK Types:

## Notes

```text
- Addresses of UNKOWN are for MultiSendMessages. These Messages do not contain the actual address. There are only a few.
- Blocks 2578098 and 4136531 are missing due to skipping on upgrades. Should I put empty Block data here?
```
